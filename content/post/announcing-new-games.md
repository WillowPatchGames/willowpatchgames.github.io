Here at Willow Patch Games, we're excited to announce several new card games
are available to play! This is a new genre we're expanding into and we hope
all y'all enjoy it.

As with all our games, we've provided extensive configuration to make the
game as realistic to your home gameplay as possible -- or just to spice it
up every once in a while.

## Spades

 | Minimum Players | Maximum Players | Game Length   |
 | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
 | 2               | 7               | About an hour |

Spades is a game of strategy and skill. Best played with 4 or 6 in pairs,
Spades requires players bid the number of tricks in their hand. However, a
bid of _zero_ isn't allowed: instead, you must bid _nil_ and commit to taking
no tricks. If you don't make your bid, a penalty is applied. First to 500
points wins!

## Hearts

 | Minimum Players | Maximum Players | Game Length   |
 | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
 | 3               | 8               | About an hour |

Hearts is a game of luck with a touch of strategy. While each player is for
themselves, rounds begins with passing a few cards left, right, or across
the table. Careful of grudges! The Queen of Spades is worth 13 points and
each Heart one when taken in a trick. Don't let someone take them all though:
it penalizes everyone else! First to 100 ends the game, at which point lowest
score wins.

## Three Thirteen

 | Minimum Players | Maximum Players | Game Length      |
 | :-------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: |
 | 2               | 15              | About 90 minutes |

Three Thirteen is an aptly-named Gin variant. Players are dealt three cards
the first round, then four, then five, and eventually up to 13 rounds. Each
round, players try to complete groups (either runs or 3 of a kinds) to remove
points from their hand. When someone reaches 0, they can go out and remaining
points are counted against each player. Count those cards though: while the
joker remains wild, each round new wild card joins the mix! Lowest score
after the thirteen-card round wins.

## Eight Jacks

 | Minimum Players | Maximum Players | Game Length      |
 | :-------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: |
 | 2               | 8               | About 20 minutes |

In this twisted recreation of a popular classic, players attempt to be the
first to create runs on a board. Each turn, a player discards a card, marks
the corresponding slot, and draws a replacement. Watch out for Jacks and
Jokers: the Jack of Clubs and Diamonds are wild and can be played anywhere;
the Jack of Spades and Hearts can remove an opponent's tile; but the Jokers
can do either! First player or team to complete the allotted number of runs
wins.

We're hard at work improving these games and plotting our next set to
implement.
