While looking for new variants of [Uno](https://www.mattelgames.com/en-us/cards/uno), we
stumbled upon Spicy Uno. An extra 6 rules on top of regular Uno, it changed our playing
of this classic. Last year for Christmas, we had gifted (and subsequently played)
[Uno Flip](https://www.mattelgames.com/en-us/cards/uno-flip), an officially sanctioned
Uno variant known for its shocking Dark Side.

We were surprised nobody appears to have published a port of Spicy Uno to the Uno Flip
card set. So, from Liz and Alex at Willow Patch Games, here's our proposal.

## Rules

In the below, rules apply to the light side. Noted below each rule is the corresponding
dark side variant, building upon the light side one.

1. When you play a `1`, you may swap hands with any player.
    - On the dark side, you **must** swap hands with another player.
    - Since you may "jump in" (see rule 5 below)  when you have an exact matching card,
      if the target of the swap has a matching `1` card and wishes to play it, it
      negates the effect of the first `1`. This occurs because in a regular Uno deck,
      `0`s are unique, whereas in the Uno Flip deck, there is no `0` card and number
      cards are not unique.
2. When you play a `6`, everyone must slap the deck. The last player to slap the deck
   must draw a single card.
    - On the dark side, the last player must draw **2** cards.
3. When you play a `7`, everyone must be silent. This effect remains until the next
   `7` is played. Anyone who speaks while silence is in effect must draw a card.
    - On the dark side, everyone must be silent **and** keep a straight face.
4. When a draw one (`+1`) card is played, you may avoid playing by "stacking" another
   draw one card if you have one. The player who cannot play must then draw the sum.
   This also applies with wild draw two (`+2`) cards. Note that `+1` and `+2` cards
   cannot be mixed on the light side.
    - On the dark side, the above applies with draw five (`+5`) and wild draw color
      (`+c`). However, here you _can_ mix and match the two types. In the event multiple
      are played, all `+5`s resolve first and then `+c` individually.
5. If you have a card that matches the current card on top of the deck, you can jump in
   and play it even if it isn't your turn. Play resumes as if it had been your turn and
   continues in the same direction.
    - On the dark side (and **unlike** the light side), you may jump in on yourself and
      even present the cards as a single unit.
6. When another player is drawing to find a card suitable to play, you may offer any of
   your cards instead. The player accepting the card need not play it, and the player
   offering player need not offer an immediately playable card.


Additionally, we make the following rule change to align Uno Flip rules with regular Uno
rules:

1. When it is your turn and you cannot play, you need to draw until you choose to play.
   You may also draw even though you could play.

Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor!
