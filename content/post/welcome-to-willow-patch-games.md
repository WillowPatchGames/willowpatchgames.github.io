Welcome to [Willow Patch Games](https://willowpatchgames.com)!

We're happy to say that we've launched after a great batch of feedback
from our [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24819100). Over
40 people turned out and played games with us during this event, and
several more emailed us showing their interest and reporting bugs.

We're excited to say we've appreciated all the feedback people gave and
are moving forward on improvements to Willow Patch Games. Our first step
is content writing to help new visitors find out what we do, and help
new players figure out how to play games.

We've got lots of ideas brewing, so bear with us a little as we get this
all figured out.

Until then, may the odds be ever in your favor!
