      <description>Backstory When we started adding card games to our repertoire, the first game we coded up was Spades. A classic among our family and friends, Iâ€™ve played it many times with (and against) my brother. The rules are pretty straightforward, but the fun twists of strategy lie in the bidding and the game play: whether your hand is good or bad depends on how others are choosing to play, as much as the luck of the cards themselves!</description>

      <title>Rules to Spicy Uno Flip</title>

      <description>While looking for new variants of Uno, we stumbled upon Spicy Uno. An extra 6 rules on top of regular Uno, it changed our playing of this classic. Last year for Christmas, we had gifted (and subsequently played) Uno Flip, an officially sanctioned Uno variant known for its shocking Dark Side.

      <description>All new adventures need those moments you go &amp;ldquo;heads down&amp;rdquo;. We here at Willow Patch Games are spending some quality time over the next few days, face-to-face, tackling the next batch of &amp;ldquo;stickies&amp;rdquo; on our Wall-of-Work.
As the newbie in the bunch, I was tasked with blogging about our activities today. Personally, I completed setup of my environment. (Thanks, Alex, for all your help troubleshooting errors!) Then, I focused on reviewing a few PRs most beginning with the Privacy Policy.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Willow Patch Games!
We&amp;rsquo;re happy to say that we&amp;rsquo;ve launched after a great batch of feedback from our Show HN. Over 40 people turned out and played games with us during this event, and several more emailed us showing their interest and reporting bugs.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to say we&amp;rsquo;ve appreciated all the feedback people gave and are moving forward on improvements to Willow Patch Games. Our first step is content writing to help new visitors find out what we do, and help new players figure out how to play games.</description>
